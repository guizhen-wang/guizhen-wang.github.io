Hello, I am Guizhen Wang (王桂珍), a Ph.D. who has created multiple data visualization systems for end-users to explore and analyze their data.
These experiences enabled me to obtain proficient programming, visualization, database, data analysis, and computer graphics knowledge.

In 2020, I completed my Ph.D. specializing in data visualization, under the supervision of [Prof. David Ebert](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ebertd/) at Purdue University. I worked as a research assistant at [Purdue/DHS Visual Analytics Center of Excellence](https://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/).  
Previously, I received a master’s degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) in the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG.

Currently, I continue a Statistics M.S. program, which needs only four more classes to complete. 

My research broadly connects to human factors, computer technologies, and data analytics. 

# Update
* Actively looking for internship opportunities.
