## Text visualization and analytics

* <strong>Visual Analytics of textual semantics</strong>
<br >Applied techniques: textual analysis algorithms (Topic modeling leveraged by Latent Dirichlet Allocation, TF-IDF) and Java programming
<br >[[Overview]](/assets/publications/topichypergraph.pdf)

* <strong>Social Media data analysis</strong>
<br >- Applied NLP libraries to detect addresses from tweets
<br >- Used Word2vec and Bert to construct tweet information representation and conducted binary classification of tweets. Tweets' spatiotemporal information were incorporated in the classification algorithm to improve classification accuracies.
